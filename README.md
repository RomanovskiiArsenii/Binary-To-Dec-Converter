# Binary-To-Dec-Converter

The first method uses convertation.

The second method takes each digit of the binary number and multiplies it by the corresponding power of 2 based on its position (from right to left). 
Then, it sums up all the resulting values to get the decimal representation. For example, to convert the binary number 1010 to decimal:
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
